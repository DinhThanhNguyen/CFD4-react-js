                            My education, career, and even personal life have been molded by one simple principle;
                            well
                            designed information resonates with people and can change lives.I have a passion for
                            making
                            information resonate. It all starts with how people think. With how humans work. As
                            humans
                            we have learned how to read and write and while that is incredible, we are also already
                            hard-wired to do some things a bit more "automatically"
